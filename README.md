# nosql-challenge

This code utilizes pymongo and pandas to import json data and analyze it. The NoSQL_setup_starter file is used to create the database and add a new record. The NoSQL_analysis_starter is where the actual analysis takes place. These queries search for restaurants based on rating, local authority, location or hygiene score.
